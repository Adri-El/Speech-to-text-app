# Speech-to-text-app
This is an app that is sensitive to speech and can carry out some simple tasks based on verbal instructions
This is more than an app that simply converts spoken words to written texts, it also carries out other operations as follows:

The app can change its background color simply by giving it verbal instructions to do so. for example, you can change the back ground color to red by saying - "change to red"
It can also direct you to google and your favourite social media sites by verbally instructing it to do so. for example, you can go to face book by simply saying- "go to facebook"
The app can also give a description of itself and its creator simply by asking "who are you" or "what's your name"
